<p class="size">
Seven billion people are on this Earth, and everybody is different from the rest of others.
 There is nothing without purpose in this world. Everything has some purpose. 
Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. 
Thus, writing about myself, I�m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life.
 I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking and honest.

<h2>My Family and My Childhood</h2>
I�m from a middle-class family of Rajasthan, I am <b>NITESH GUPTA</b>. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends.
 Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. 
<b>My father</b> is a respectable businessman in our community.
</br>
<b>My mother</b> is a Housewife.
That�s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.
</br>
We are three brothers.
 Being the youngest I am the most liable from my brothers.
I am wanted to guide and take care of my other siblings. Reading is my passion.
</br>
I am a keen reader of novels and history books as I have a strong interest in <b>Competative Programming</b> .
At my pre-childhood, I used to listen to stories from my grandmother, and this has a long-lasting effect on me.

<h2>My Education</h2>
I am studying at the <b>NIT DELHI</b>.
 I am presently in 3rd year of my B-tech. 
I feel happy to be a part of this great college with the good friends, helpful and loving professors and sound college administration.
 I have extraordinary skills in some subjects whereas I am very weak in the few.

<h2>My Strengths</h2>
In compare to studies, I am good at sports and programming.
Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics. I am in expert swimming.
The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits.
 I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie.
 My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do so.
 I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: �Happiness is not out there; it�s in you.�</br></br>
I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk.
 I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again.
 Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news.
I always try to speak to every person according to his requirement so I understand people.
<h2>My Weaknesses</h2>
As every man have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like. While playing time,
 I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.

<h2>My Ambitions in Life</h2>
Everybody has an ambition in life.
 Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man.
 No man can do anything in the world without aim.
 So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.
</br></br>
Without good career planning, right from the start, one can�t be on the right track.
 One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences.
 One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings.
 Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity I can.
